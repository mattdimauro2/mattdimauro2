# Matthew DiMauro

I’m a data analyst in Boston, MA, with a B.S. in Data Analytics from Bentley University (’20). I’ve honed my skills in Python, Tableau, and SQL through professional projects, including creating a predictive model that optimized resource allocation for low-performing programs in my current role at the Office of Head Start. I also built the Pickleball Hotspot Prediction project (link below), merging geospatial and trend data to uncover the top US cities for tournament expansion. I am focused on data-driven solutions, from predictive models to visualizations, and I’m targeting analytics roles in Boston.

As a detail-oriented guy, I once memorized 400 digits of Pi in high school which was certainly a fun challenge.
